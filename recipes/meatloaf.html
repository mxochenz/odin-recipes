    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This traditional meatloaf recipe made with saut√©ed vegetables, spices, and
      bread crumbs is moist and flavorful and topped with an old-fashioned
      glaze. Cook time will depend on the size and shape of your loaf, as well
      as the type of baking pan you use. Serve this hearty meal on cool fall or
      winter evenings with mashed potatoes and a simple mushroom gravy.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ground Chuck: This recipe calls for ground chuck, but some reviewers
        like to use other kinds of ground meat (like beef or venison).
      </li>
      <li>
        Vegetables: The nearly-pureed carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper,
        mushrooms, and garlic will keep the meatloaf moist and flavorful.
      </li>
      <li>
        Worcestershire: Sauce A tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce gives the
        meatloaf its umami-rich flavor.
      </li>
      <li>Egg: The egg helps bind the meatloaf together.</li>
      <li>
        Spices: Chef John uses dried Italian herbs, salt, pepper, and cayenne
        pepper to season his meatloaf.
      </li>
      <li>Bread Crumbs: Bread crumbs will bind the meatloaf together.</li>
      <li>
        Glaze: This meatloaf has a glaze made with brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon
        mustard, and sriracha.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        Chop the Vegetables: Combine the vegetables and garlic in a food
        processor until nearly pureed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form the Meatloaf: Combine the vegetables, ground chuck, Worcestershire
        sauce, spices, and egg. Sprinkle in the bread crumbs and mix them with
        your hands (be careful not to overmix).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Form the meat mixture into a loaf and place it in a prepared
        baking pan. Bake for about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the Glaze: Combine brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon, and sriracha to
        make the glaze.
